The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic brought sudden and practically permanente changes into the routine and social relationships, resulting in a notable intensification of public interest in issues focused on and directed at mental health. This increase is directly reflected in a noticeable growth in the psychology market, which due to the impacts caused by the pandemic, also began to show an acute tendency to integrate itself with technology. Therefore, the present work, called PsyCare, proposes to develop a web platform for psychological attendance, helping both the patient and the professional during most of the therapy process. To handle the implementation, PostgreSQL was used to manage the database, integrated with NestJS to develop the back-end API and ReactJS to implement the front-end interfaces. At the end of this work, it was possible to present an accessible and effective system that assists, organizes and centralizes the therapeutic attendance process. \\
